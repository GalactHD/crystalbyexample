Methods (or functions) are a way to reuse code, avoiding the repetition of logic and consequently making programming simpler.

In Crystal, methods are declared with `def` and ended with `end`, and parentheses are optional.

Methods need to be called to work. In Crystal, you can simply write the method name without the need for parentheses.

Crystal allows method overriding—you can create multiple methods with the same name, but depending on the order of the call, the effects may vary.

Arguments or parameters are a way to pass data to a function, and in Crystal, methods may or may not have parameters.

Methods can return values. In Crystal, this is done using `return`, or you can place the value as the last expression in the method, which has the same effect.


<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('methods')}/>
