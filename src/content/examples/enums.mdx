Enums are a group of named constants.

To access a constant from an enum, use the scope resolution operator `::`, and to access the value of that constant, use `.value`.

To change the type of the enum’s value, which is `Int32` by default, it is only necessary to annotate the type as you would for a variable, constant, or method.

Enums have values and are numbered starting from 0. The default value of a constant in the enum can be changed, and all subsequent constants in order will be updated accordingly.

Enums accept the use of both symbols and constants, but this only works in certain cases, such as in methods.
