Errors are a fundamental part of software development and are important for diagnosing problems. They should not be avoided, they should be used to solve a problem.

In Crystal, errors can be raised using the `raise` keyword, which immediately stops the program when the error occurs. They support both messages and classes that inherit from the `Exception` class.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('exceptions')}/>

```
$ crystal run exceptions.cr

hi
Unhandled exception: Cannot say hi! (Exception)
  from exceptions.cr:12 in '__crystal_main'

```
