The `if` and `else` structures are conditional structures; they check whether a value is true or false and execute code based on that. Crystal has `if`, `else`, and `unless` to handle conditions.

The `if` and `unless` structures do not depend on `else`, which means you don’t need to use `else` every time.

`unless` is the opposite of `if`.

`elsif` is a sub-structure that is optional but is used to handle another `if` when the first condition is false. There can be many `elsif` statements in the code.

Crystal also has ternary operators, which are a short version of `if` `else`. The language also supports suffix conditions, allowing values to be assigned conditionally.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('if-else')}/>

$ crystal run if-else.cr

a is not bigger than 10!
a is not equal or bigger than 6
a have no correlation with y
5
