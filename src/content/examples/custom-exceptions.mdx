Exceptions are good, but there are times when it is necessary to have specific exceptions, such as an operation involving a database, login, or even file uploads.

To define a custom exception, you use the `Exception` class by inheriting from it. This way, it can be used with the `raise` keyword and by initializing the class.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('custom-exceptions')}/>

```
$ crystal run custom-exceptions.crystal

Unhandled exception: Cannot use E (2.72) where! (CannotUseE)
  from custom-exceptions.cr:10 in '__crystal_main'
```
