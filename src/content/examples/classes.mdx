Classes are used to organize code. They combine data and actions in one place. Each class serves as a blueprint for creating objects with their own values and behaviors.

Crystal uses classes; the language is class-based because it is object-oriented.

The `initialize` method runs when we create a new object with `.new`. It sets the initial values of the object.

Classes can have methods, which perform actions, and variables, which store information. These variables are accessed with @ inside the class.

A `getter` creates a way to read a value, a `setter` creates a way to change a value, and `property` does both at the same time.

`self` represents the object itself. It is used to call a method from within the same class.

With inheritance, a class can use what another class already has by writing `<`. The child class can modify or enhance what it inherited from the parent class.

An abstract class is a type of class that serves only as a model. It cannot be instantiated directly and defines methods that other classes must implement.
