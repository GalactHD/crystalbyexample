Visibility in programming is a simple concept: controlling what should be public or private.

In Crystal, methods, variables, constants, and classes are public by default, meaning all files in the project have access to them. To change this, you need to use visibility modifiers such as `private` and `protected`.

In the example, the secret recipe method is private, it can only be accessed by methods, variables, or any other structure within the same module. The sausage-making method, on the other hand, is public and can be called normally from outside.

`private` can also be used with classes, constants, and properties.

The `protected` modifier is used for methods that can only be accessed within the same class or its subclasses, allowing controlled communication between related types.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('visibility')}/>

```
$ crystal run visibility.cr
