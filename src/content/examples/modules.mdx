Modules in Crystal are used to organize code and share functionality. They can contain methods, constants, and types, but they cannot be instantiated.

Using modules as namespaces is simple—use the `::` operator to access what is inside the module.

`include` adds the module's methods as instance methods to the class or struct that includes it, and `extend` adds the module's methods as class methods, tied to the class or struct itself.

Inside the module, `self` can be used to create methods that belong to the module itself.
Modules do not allow inheritance, but they can be included in multiple classes or structs to reuse code.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('modules')}/>

```
$ crystal run modules.cr
