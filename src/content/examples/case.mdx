`case` is a flow control structure based on conditions. This structure allows writing multiple conditions without using multiple `if`s, which makes the code cleaner.

`case` has the `when`, which gives the condition; if it is true, the code is executed. The `else` comes at the end in case none of the conditions are true.

The use of `then` allows the `case` structure to be written on just one line, and to compare several conditions in the same `when`, a comma is used.

<Code lang='crystal' code={await loadCode('case')}/>

```
$ crystal run case.cr

a is five
y is 5
It's a integer or float.
```
