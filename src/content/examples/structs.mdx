Structs in Crystal are similar to classes, but they are allocated on the stack, which is a fast-access memory area, making them "lighter" than classes.

Structs can only inherit from structs marked as abstract. Abstract structs cannot be instantiated directly and only serve as a base for other structs.

Structs can also serve as types, and this is commonly the case in composite data structures (structs containing other structs).
